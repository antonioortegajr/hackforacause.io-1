# WordPress

## Theme

This theme will be based off the [HTML5blank](http://html5blank.com/) theme. This is open source and as minimal as possible.

The theme files will be customized to fit the design.

This will be headers.php and footer.php in the theme

## Plugins

As the Gutenberg project is not yet part of WordPress core, the plugin will be required.

[Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/)

This is to make use of the WordPress block system for the home page or pages.

## Multi site

Instead of going down the multi site road, the same site can be used for all. With custom home pages for each city and subpages un a city name category.
